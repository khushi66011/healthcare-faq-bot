📘 HEALTHBOT CHATBOT PROJECT DOCUMENTATION
1. Project Title

Healthbot – Web Based Medical Chatbot Using Python Flask

2. Introduction

Healthbot is a web-based chatbot designed to provide basic medical guidance to users by interacting in a conversational format. The chatbot accepts symptoms from the user and provides preliminary advice using a Python Flask backend.

The system consists of a frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and a backend developed using Python Flask that processes user queries and returns suitable responses.

This project demonstrates client-server communication, REST API integration, and rule-based chatbot logic.

3. Objectives

• Provide basic health assistance through chatbot interaction
• Reduce manual consultation for minor symptoms
• Implement frontend-backend communication
• Learn Flask API development
• Improve user experience using chatbot UI

4. Technologies Used
Frontend:

HTML

CSS

JavaScript

Backend:

Python

Flask Framework

Flask-CORS

7. Working of the System

User opens chatbot interface

User clicks "Get Started"

User enters symptoms (fever, cold, pain etc.)

Message is sent to Flask server

Flask processes message using conditions

Response is sent back as JSON

Chatbot displays medical advice

8. Backend Logic Explanation

The Flask server receives POST requests containing user messages.
Based on keywords, the system determines the response.

Example:

"fever" → asks about temperature

"cold" → suggests rest and warm fluids

"pain" → suggests doctor consultation

9. Features

✔ Chatbot-style UI
✔ Python backend processing
✔ REST API communication
✔ Rule-based symptom checker
✔ Responsive layout
✔ Beginner-friendly logic

10. Advantages

• Easy to use
• Fast response
• Reduces workload on clinics
• Available 24/7
• Can be upgraded with AI

11. Limitations

• Not a replacement for doctor
• Limited symptom database
• Rule-based (not intelligent AI yet)

12. Future Enhancements

AI-based NLP chatbot

Voice interaction

Database for patient records

Doctor recommendation system

Medicine dosage suggestions

13. Conclusion

Healthbot successfully demonstrates how a chatbot can assist users with basic medical guidance using web technologies and Python backend.

The project combines frontend design with backend logic, showing practical implementation of REST APIs and real-time user interaction.

This system can be further enhanced into a full healthcare assistant using AI technologies.
